As per class requirements the repository contains three Word Documents, detailing a chosen development approach
concerning the three systems discussed and the rationale explaining our choice for using this approach.

The three systems in question are:

1. Insulin Pump (Safety critical)
  A system controlling insulin levels of a Patient via administering and regulating the dosage of insulin. Purpose is to regulate the blood sugar levels of the patient.

2. Patient Records for Mental healthcare system (Information system)
  A system containing read/write access of patient medical records concerning mental health to be used by clinics and the stakeholders pertaining to the system.

3.Wilderness weather Station (Data collection and analysis system/ sensor based)(System of Systems?)
  A system that monitors various types of weather. Situated in remote locations.


The Choice of Development approaches are:

a. Bespoke - custom software built to specifications

b. COTS - Commercial off the shelf software. Ready to use Software tailored for specific use cases.

c. Hybrid - A mix of COTS and Bespoke software

d. Open Source(two subsets) 
        - 1. Community: software developed by a decentralised community ; often for free, for the purpose of free use. 
        2. Commercial: Similar to community with the exception of licenses/trademarks/patents for distribution of software being held by a single entity. May charge    money for use of service.

e. Proprietary: developed by a single entity that retains full control of the software.

f. SaaS:A natural Extension of COTS.
